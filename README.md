## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

- `<body>` and most block elements take up the height of their content
- To make images scalable, use:

```css
width: 100%;
```

- To center any element, best option is flexbox.
- An `<h1>` tag in an `<aside>` tag has a default 1.5em font-size
- A `<p>` tag in an `<aside>` tag has a default 1em font-size

### Continued development

- Implement a good box-shadow around the component

### Useful resources
